# transform-z
The purpose of this code is to synthesize a system from its z-transform. This role must meet certain characteristics that must be demonstrated. In this case Using the z Transform, design a real function, whose amplitude is decreasing. For this function draw the pole-zero diagram, the pole position, and the Fourier transform.
